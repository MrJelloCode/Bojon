# Bojon 🎙️⚔️

**Bojon** is a real-time 1v1 competitive interview game built for **Hack the 6ix 2025**. Players are matched by ELO, receive the same interview question, and submit spoken answers via webcam. The best answer wins. Designed to gamify interview prep under pressure.

## 🕹️ How It Works

1. Players log in via Auth0.
2. They're matched in real-time with another player at a similar skill level.
3. An interview question is generated by **Gemini** and read aloud using **Ribbon**.
4. Both players have **20 seconds** to record and submit their answer via webcam.
5. The answers are analyzed using **Twelve Labs**, which returns a score out of 100.
6. ELO rankings are updated — winner climbs the leaderboard.
